##  How to Run

1. Open the main notebook in Google Colab:  
    [notebook_1.ipynb on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13HRtWsBn0044VSJFmWnDxI9TatYs45Un?usp=sharing)

2. Make sure runtime has access to Google Drive (for data download).  

3. Run all cells:
   - `csv_files/` will be populated with intermediate results.  
   - `outputs/` will contain charts & plots.  
   - `ds_report.pdf` will be generated automatically at the end.
